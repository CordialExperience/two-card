# Test Project

Create a card game which meets the following acceptance criteria:

- By default, this card game is played with two players
- Display a "Play" button in the UI
- Clicking the "Play" button will deal hands to all players and determine a winner
    - Deal cards from one standard 52-card deck
    - A hand contains seven cards
- Display those hands in the UI
- The winner of the game is determined by the number of pairs a hand contains
- Visually indicate which player has won the round
- Mark each hand's pairs with a colored border
    - Each pair in a hand should have a unique border color.

- Whenever the "Play" button is pressed again, new hands will be dealt and a new winner will be determined
