2. In order to run test run `npm run test`
3. In order to start run `npm start`

## Implementation comments
* I tried to not spent entire day to make the implementation perfect-perfect, but rather to have reasonable good.
* Only bussiness logic is covered by tests, in fact they were specs, I was writting tets first - only after that I was creating implementation of functions
* There are still few things which could be improved, but they are minor
